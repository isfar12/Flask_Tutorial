# Basics of Blueprint and Basic Application
When we talk about web frameworks such as Django, React, They are big frameworks. So They can deal many apps together in one place. For example, Let's talk about
Facebook. So consider ``Facebook`` as a project. It has many parts. ``Messeging``, ``Groups``, ``Marketplace`` where you can sell and buy stuffs. All this are a single
apps. These apps has many functionalities and features of their own. And they are all linked to the main project. That is ``Facebook``. Let's see a diagram:

Now all the big frameworks, such as Django, React, VueJS and so on has this features built in. They have automatic directory and paths, and all the tools to make
big project. Here is a look of Django and React project directory:

The left one is Django and the right one is React. Now flask can be also modified to make big projects like with multiple apps. This is done through a very 
poplular module named  ``Flask-Blueprint``. By using it, we can easily make a complete project and link apps together. That is the basic of Blueprint.
