1.child_namesqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: Error creating backref 'base' on relationship 'Base.childs': property of that name exists on mapper 'Mapper[Child(child)]'

--->This error happens when names of any class variable matches the attribute of or the name of other calsses variable or attribute
so just change the names or make sure that in no ways, two classes name,attribute does not match

2.Even after creating all the tables this erros shows:
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: base

--->Means you are running the app in the wrong directory.change the terminal directory to where you are writing the code
it should work now

3.AttributeError: 'Child' object has no attribute 'name'

--->This is because i wrote the name of the variable wrong at any place,debug to fix it.

4.werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'functioname'. Did you mean 'index' instead?

--->this happens because of url_function not redirecting properly to the corresponding function
write the url redirecting clearly and carefully

5.sqlalchemy.exc.NoReferencedTableError: Foreign key associated with column 'pet foods.liked_by' could not find table 'pet' 
with which to generate a foreign key to target column 'pet_id'

-->This is very simple.sqlalchemy is sensitive and any class variable, object between classes matching would return error while
creating relationship between them. so make sure two relationship making table does not have same name variable or anything anyhow

6.sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: users_table

-->This happens because either the table is not created or the directory of the running program is wrong.
so go the working directory and then run the program. this will work mostly.

7. RuntimeError: No application found. 

--> set the FLASK_APP variable to the app.py or the flask file.this often happens while running migrations and flask shell command
